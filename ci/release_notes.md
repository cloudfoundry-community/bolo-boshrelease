## Improvements

- Upgrade to [bolo v0.3.0][bolo-release].

- Per-subscriber submission and subscription address/port
  configuration are now gone, in favor of a globally-settable set
  of parameters.  This means that dbolo.submission.\*, and
  bolo.rrd.submission.\* are now just bolo.submission.\*.
